User Story

Create a web application with a client-side application using a server-side API application (Ruby, Python, Java, Golang) which in itself uses Zomato API.
Required features:

    Add 5-10 Indian cities as seed data.
    Basic user signup/login and a profile page (needless to say any part of the application should not be accessible without authentication)
    Use the cities to fetch restaurant results. Good to have paginated results.
    Add search functionality to fetch results based on a search keyword.
    Search results should be in the card form on UI. Try to make search page UI appealing.
    Add functionality to favorite a restaurant and show them on the profile page.
    Add booking functionality to a restaurant with start time and the number of guests (maximum 6). To keep it simple, we will assume that all booking will end after 1 hour
    If the total guests across the bookings exceed by 20. Show error message for the new bookings
    Every area should be navigable which means that any page should not require navigation through address bar of the browser.
    Make sure your code is well structured and reusable.

Bonus points

    Using javascript frameworks like angularjs, reactjs, etc for client-side application.
    Whole application should look nice and user-friendly (don't need to glorify or do extra )
    better API response and error handling
    Basic filter and sorting on the search page.
    API tests for favorite and booking functionalities

Make a git repository and push the code with meaningful commits showing separate functionalities. Add instructions on README for installation and deployment.
